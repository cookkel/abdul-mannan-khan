        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I possess extensive multinational teaching experience across Pakistan, South Korea, and the United Kingdom. In my role as an Assistant Professor at the University of Engineering and Technology in Taxila, Pakistan, I achieved notable success in research funding, securing the prestigious National Research Program for Universities grant – a unique accomplishment within the faculty. My efforts were instrumental in obtaining accreditation for the department's degree from the Washington Accord, enabling recognition in the USA for the first time. I played a crucial role as the main editor of the Self-Assessment Report and was pivotal in the development of the Continuous Quality Improvement loop. Additionally, I spearheaded the successful initiation of the M.Sc. Mechatronics Engineering program at UET Taxila's Chakwal Sub-Campus and managed the Final Year Projects for the B.Sc. Mechatronics Engineering program.</p>
        <p>I have taught various subjects at the University of Engineering and Technology, Taxila, Pakistan, Hanyang University and Hanbat National University in South Korea, and Brunel University London, UK. Additionally, I have mentored students at these universities, as well as at the University of Bristol, UK, guiding them to produce high-quality research.</p>

        <h2>Research Summary</h2>
        <p>I have expertise in robotics, backed by a strong mathematical and programming background, and have authored 22 journal publications in the field of human-robot interaction, bioinspired robots, UAVs, and drones. My research spans a diverse array of robotic systems, covering rehabilitation robotics, soft robotics (<a href="#">video</a>), manipulators (<a href="#">video</a>), mobile robots (<a href="#">video</a>), and drones (<a href="#">video</a>). These projects are an accumulation of my strong expertise in embedded systems and programming languages including C/C++ and Python. My academic qualifications include a Ph.D. in Mechanical Design Engineering. I hold UKRI Global Talent endorsement and the resultant Global Talent Visa.</p>
